# Vigenere-Cipher

A simple Python script that encrypts a user's phrase with a randomly chosen built-in key word.
Then, with the same keyword, it decrypts the encrypted phrase back to the original.
Time complexity was reduced through the use of hash maps during encryption and decryption function calls.
This was a computer security lab leading up to topics on RSA encryption methods.
